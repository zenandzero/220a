  <h1>Homework 5: Gametrack Gamelan</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The main idea is to play a game of call and response with ChucK. I play something on the guitar and a response is generated. In this case I played a very liberal interpretation of the first 14 bars of Davidovsky's Synchronism No. 10 and recorded the live output of both the guitar and ChucK. I sight read through the piece and kept take #10 with no editing, so take the interpretation with a grain of salt :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm playing, ChucK latches the last pitch I played (as determined by FFT). Our control loop checks for ambient noise falling below a certain level. When it does, this is its queue to begin a response. When I stop playing, the response begins with a sequence of pitches based on the latched fundamental pitch. We sample from a logistic map to determine the duration of each note played. We introduce some further modulation by randomly changing the fundamental to some other pitch class.

      I reused the FM Instrument from the last homework to generate some new sounds.
