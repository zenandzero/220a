  <h1>Homework 5: Gametrack Gamelan</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I built a Gamelan-inspired instrument using a Gametrak controller. The principle idea was to keep the controls as simple and intuitive as possible. To this effect the left axes control the pitch (in a pentatonic scale) and the right axes control the octave of the pitch (across four octaves). The velocity of attack (the gain of our instrument) is controlled by the velocity towards the pitch on the left controller.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the main challenges was properly tuning our instrument to something that played comfortably (and sounded good). In order to achieve this, we introduce hysterisis by requiring that a minimum time has elapsed before we re-strike the Gamelan in response to input. We only evaluate pitch and octave if we have new HID events, and we also require that the velocity exceed some threshold. It really feels like you're hitting a Gamelan!
